## Introduction

Web3Foundation's core goals is to further the development of primarily Polkadot and, secondarily, the Web3 ecosystem.

Rust and WASM have been chosen as the foundation on which to develop solutions for Substrate. However, Rust developers are limited in number and despite growing popularity Rust and WASM do not yet dominate the ever conservative enterprise ecosystem. 

Enterprise-friendly compatibility is a imperative for the growth of Polkadot. Therefore, we propose to create a .NET  implementation for Polkadot under the Web3Foundation grant programme. 

The proposed solution will comprise a universal toolkit (similar to .NET) designed to allow creation of smart contracts for Polkadot/Substrate in  .NET, and is strategically complementary to the C++ implementation grant awarded to Soramitsu team.

## Ecosystem Benefits

We believe implementation of this toolkit will allow to attract a large number of developers to the ecosystem.

## Polkadot Benefits

.NET is universal platform that supports a wide variety of languages and execution environments.

.NET implementation will help Polkadot become out-of-the-box enterprise-ready and expand its ecosystem capture to a wide array of languages and use cases, already adopted by the enterprise.

- Enterprises development environment is characterised by a fairly conservative set of demands (IBM, RedHat (acquired by IBM), Azure by Microsoft in .NET, Oracle)
- Facilitates Polkadot being able to address enterprise market, since the majority of enterprise development currently takes place in C# and Java.
- Expands the universe of node candidates and network participants leading to greater network stability and DOT use

## Monetisation

The software will be released under open source license. We propose to mirror validated OSS monetisation models, successfully deployed by such players as RedHat:

- Corporations will need support and customisation of open source product, which will be provided for a fee (similarly to RedHat business model).
- Outsourced enterprise blockchain development. Examples of enterprise products are private or hybrid blockchains for supply chain, fintech and game development.

## Target Programming Language

.NET Languages, ะก#

## Development Roadmap

We estimate an approximate 6-month commitment to complete the project, allowing for a detailed Substrate analysis, which we have commenced already.  


We intend to have 2 C# developers full-time and 1 Rust developer full-time.

Indicative **milestones:**

- Implement codec (weeks 0 - 3).
- Implement Trie DB (weeks 3 - 6).
- Implement libp2p in ะก# (weeks 7 - 12).
- Implement a Wasm interpeter in C# (weeks 12 - 18).
- Implement Consensus algorithm (weeks 19 - 23).
- Integrate all parts together and works as intended (weeks 24 - 26).
